    <p class="paragraph">The abundance of tourist guides and tourist promotions created by tourism authorities or by
      municipalities includes mainly cultural, accommodation, and food and nightlife options. The disadvantage of those
      guides is the lack of information about which areas are the most attractive and famous according to the
      preferences as well as the spatial and temporal distribution of tourists.However, geosocial data gives the
      solution to this problem providing information about tourists that can be analyzed and contributed to the tourism
      decision-making process.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="paragraph">This web-GIS project is created within the framework of the MSc program in GIS of the
      Department of Physical Geography of Lund University, as a result of the final semester dissertation and aims to
      disclose spatial and temporal patterns of tourists by mining big spatial data from Flickr social media
      platform.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The results depicted in this page are all derived from an <a
      href="https://thesis-tourism.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"> API </a> specific created for
      this thesis.The Top Attraction pins were provided by a local tourism agency <a href="https://travelgenius.gr/"
                                                                                     target="_blank">Travel Genius</a>
      as well as from famous travel sites such as <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/" target="_blank">Lonely
        Planet</a> and <a href="http://www.visitgreece.gr/#&slider1=1" target="_blank">Visit Greece </a>. Through the
      API,
      geotagged photos with additional information were requested from Flickr's API, for the years 2009-2019. Then the
      received geosocial data were cleaned, analyzed and clustered in order to produce the most visited areas in Athens.
      The resulted Areas Of Interest are presented in the map as circles and they are visual images of the traces,
      visitors left behind, by uploading photos in Flickr, from 2009 to 2019.
